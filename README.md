# WebSpider

DESCRIPTION:
WebSpider is a Python script designed primarily for CTF challenges. The WebCrawler.py script recursively extracts all links, including those from subdomains and additional directories. It then invokes LinkProber.py to filter out live links and store them in a file. These scripts were developed with the specific purpose of helping participants find useful information during CTF events.

NOTE: These scripts are not intended for large-scale website crawling. I greatly respect organizational policies and ethical considerations. Unauthorized or illegal web crawling using these scripts is both unfeasible and against the intended use. I assume no responsibility for any misuse or legal consequences resulting from the use of these scripts.
