# WebSpider

DESCRIPTION:

WebSpider is a Python script designed primarily for CTF challenges. The WebCrawler.py script recursively extracts all links, including those from subdomains and additional directories. It then invokes LinkProber.py to filter out live links and store them in a file. These scripts were developed specifically to help participants find useful information during CTF events. Note that these scripts do not implement rate-limiting, depth control, or more sophisticated web crawling techniques, which supports my point.

NOTE: These scripts are not intended for large-scale website crawling. I greatly respect organizational policies and ethical considerations. Unauthorized or illegal web crawling using these scripts is both infeasible and against their intended use. I assume no responsibility for any misuse or legal consequences resulting from the use of these scripts.
